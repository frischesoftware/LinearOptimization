Linear Optimization
-------------------

Remember your class on linear optimization? 

"A business makes 2 products. Each product requires different amounts of 3 ingredients which are of limited supply. Both products yield a specific profit, and there's an overall constraint on the factory capacity. What's the ideal combination of products to make?"

That was roughly the excercise we had to solve in class, and that was it. The simplex algorithm that we used was too complicated to be taught for real, so we were just expected to memorize the steps and apply it.

Oh and we briefly heard that out there, aparently people were using this for  [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research#Problems_addressed). But we didn't go into any of that, and the pen-and-paper simplex method wouldn't be useful for that anyway.

This is of course unacceptable, so I made linear-optimization.com

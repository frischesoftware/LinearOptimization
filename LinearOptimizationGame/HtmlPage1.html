                        But maybe your course hasn't really spent a lot of time explaining the concepts. Chances are you've
                        forgotten some of the details already. Right now, the Simplex Algorithm is probably not
                        the first thing on your mind when you have to work out a specific problem.
                        You might not even recognize that the problem at hand can be solved by Linear Optimization?

                        If you want Linear Optimization to be a real skill for you, you've come to the right place - we'll get you
                        in shape!
